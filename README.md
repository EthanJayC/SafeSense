Safesense, my final year project, designed to keep students informed by other students of any criminal/anti-social activity around the city.

As the app hasn't got a build, the way to currently run it is to download Expo Go app on your device

Open the project in VSCode:
- In the terminal type: npx expo
- Once the localhost is running, scroll up the terminal to find the QR code
- use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code
- The app will load on your device.
